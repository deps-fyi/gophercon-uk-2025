## Licensing (via `external_licenses`)

Do we have licenses from external sources i.e. SBOMs?

```sql external_licenses
select
    *
from
    external_licenses;
```

## Licensing (via https://deps.dev)

(_Based on <Value data={pct_depsdev_licenses_available} />% of dependencies that **may** have a license from Deps.dev_)

```sql pct_depsdev_licenses_available
select
    num_licenses / num_deps * 100 as pct_deps_licenses,
from
    (
        select
            (
                select
                    count(*)
                from
                    (
                        -- NOTE that our setup with deps.dev doesn't currently take the `package_type` into account
                        select
                            distinct package_name
                        from
                            renovate
                    )
            ) as num_deps,
            (
                select
                    count(distinct package_name)
                from
                    depsdev_licenses
                    -- NOTE that our setup with deps.dev doesn't currently take the `package_type` into account
            ) as num_licenses
    )
```

```sql license_breakdown
select
    license,
    count(*)
from
    renovate
    right join depsdev_licenses on renovate.package_name = depsdev_licenses.package_name
    and (
        renovate.version = depsdev_licenses.version
        or renovate.current_version = depsdev_licenses.version
    )
group by
    license
order by
    count(*) desc
```
