### Dependencies with very poor code review, who are looking for funding

(_Based on <Value data={pct_scorecard_reports_available} />% of dependencies that have OpenSSF Security Scorecard Reports_)

This leverages other information we have about dependencies, via [Ecosystems](https://ecosyste.ms), which is in the `dependency_health` table.

```sql very_poor_code_review_funding
select
    package_type as name,
    count(*) as value
from
    (
        select
            distinct renovate.package_name,
            renovate.package_type
        from
            renovate
            inner join dependency_health on renovate.package_name = dependency_health.package_name
            and renovate.package_type = dependency_health.package_type
        where
            -- some / very poor code review
            (scorecard_codereview < 7)
            and scorecard_codereview is not null
            and scorecard_codereview != -1
            and -- looking for funding
            (ecosystems_funding is not null)
    )
group by
    package_type
order by
    count(*) desc
