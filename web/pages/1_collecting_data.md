title: 1. Collecting Data
---
Let's start by collecting the data we'll use in our workshop.

1. Clone [deps-fyi/gophercon-uk-2025](https://github.com/deps-fyi/gophercon-uk-2025) locally
1. Pull the container image via `make -C ./container-image/scanner pull`
    - Alternatively, you can [build from source](https://github.com/deps-fyi/gophercon-uk-2025#building-from-source)
1. Determine which repositories you want to use, and which platform (GitHub.com / GitLab.com)

<Alert status=info>
Don't have access to repositories you want to run against, or don't have your laptop?
